    I am research group leader for

    in the
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.geo.uzh.ch/en/units/h2k">hydrology and climate unit (H<sub>2</sub>K)</a>
    and "privatdozent" for physical geography and hydrology at the
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.geo.uzh.ch/en.html">Department of Geography</a>,
    University of Zurich.

    My main research interest is centred on water in mountain areas, both in the Alps as well as world-wide.
    Within this topic, I try to answer questions concerning water resources, natural hazards and hydrological processes.
    Iâ€™m also particularly interested in changes in the Earth system, especially as regards climate and land use as well as demographic and socio-economic developments.
    For the more applied aspects of my research I can draw from extensive industry and field experience in flood estimation, hydraulic engineering and natural hazards assessments.

    Every now and then I like to take pictures, you will find a few of them around here as well.
